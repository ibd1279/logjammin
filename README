After installing the necessary libraries, Open the project in xcode, and
verify header search and library search paths are correct.


Installation:

Paths are hard coded at the moment, so execute the following commands as root:

mkdir -p /var/db/logjammin
chown _www:wheel /var/db/logjammin
./install.sh

This will create the directory where logjammin stores its files, grant the
apache service ownership of the directory.

The install.sh script copies the presentation files to the /var/db/logjammin
directory, and copies the logjammin executable to the
/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables directory.

If everything worked, you should be able to hit logjammin at
http://localhost/cgi-bin/logjammin

Since the database is empty by default, you need to execute the seed. This is 
currently hard coded, but can be invoked by going to
http://localhost/cgi-bin/logjammin/__seed

After running the seed, three users will exist and a default project.


Debug:

Use the error_log in apache. Your best friend.

Another useful command is:
tcbmgr list -pv /var/db/logjammin/<db>
This will show you the values stored in the database file provided.
