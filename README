LogJammin 0.1

What is it?
LogJammin is a data storage system with a focus on security. The current goal
is to create a database with enough security and user isolation to enable using
it for a personal online diary, or an online password safe.  To this end,
non-tls connections are limited in what they can do/access; user password
authentication is done using scrypt; records are easily AES-256 encrypted using
a key that can be different per user; etc.

Depends on the following libraries:
    cryptopp
    openssl
    lua
    pthreads

Configure using:
    ./waf configure

Build using:
    ./waf build
