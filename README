LogJammin 0.1

What is it?
LogJammin is a data storage system with a focus on security. The current goal
is to create a database with enough security and user isolation to enable using
it for a personal online diary, or an online password safe.  To this end,
non-tls connections are limited in what they can do/access; user password
authentication is done using scrypt; records are easily AES-256 encrypted using
a key that can be different per user; etc. Some basic BitCoin fundimentals have
been added as well

Depends on the following libraries:
    nettle 2.7+ (for the ECDSA support)
    gnutls 3.1+
    lua 5.2
    pthreads 
    a C++11 compiler

Configure using:
    ./waf configure (linux)
    CXX=clang++ ./waf configure (mac)

Build using:
    ./waf build
